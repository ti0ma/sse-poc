# Server Sent Events POC

Run `npm install` in both folders

## server
`npm start`

## front
`npm run dev`

- Go to http://localhost:3000/ and leave as many tabs open as you want (even in your phone, tablet, etc changing localhost with the ip)
- Go to http://localhost:3000/admin.html in another tab
- Press the buttons and see the magic :) (all the tabs running index.html will change their color)

The admin page is like a remote, and all the tabs recieve the commands sent by it.
